  <h2>About This Tool</h2>

  <p>Absolutely -- I've reviewed the application in detail and can generate a friendly, brewer-focused user guide that explains both what the app does and how to use it to improve your beer by mastering small process changes.</p>

  <p>Below is a complete first-draft User Guide written for an enthusiastic home brewer audience. It's structured so it could be used as a README, website Help section, or the foundation of a printable manual.</p>

  <h2>Beer Fault Finder</h2>
  <h3>A Practical Guide to Brewing Better Beer Through Sensory Awareness</h3>

  <p>Welcome! If you've ever brewed a beer that was almost perfect, Beer Fault Finder is here to help you close that last gap. This application is designed to help home brewers understand how small changes in process, ingredients, and handling can dramatically affect the final beer -- sometimes for better, sometimes not so much.</p>

  <p>Beer Fault Finder isn't about telling you that you brewed a bad beer. It's about giving you tools to taste with intention, connect flavors to process decisions, and level up your brewing consistency.</p>

  <p>Let's dive in.</p>

  <h3>What Is Beer Fault Finder?</h3>

  <p>Beer Fault Finder is a web-based brewing education and diagnostic tool focused on off-flavors and process risks. It helps you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn to identify common beer faults</li>
    <li>Understand where in the brewing process they originate</li>
    <li>See which styles are most sensitive to certain mistakes</li>
    <li>Train your palate with sensory exercises and flashcards</li>
    <li>Generate printable study sheets, scorecards, and troubleshooting guides</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Think of it as a sensory lab notebook meets brewing coach.</p>

  <h3>Getting Oriented: The Main Sections</h3>

  <h4>Home / Flavor Library</h4>
  <p>The home page presents the Flavor Library -- the heart of the application.</p>
  <p>Each entry includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flavor name (e.g., Diacetyl)</li>
    <li>Nickname (e.g., Buttery)</li>
    <li>Plain-language description</li>
    <li>Common beer styles where it appears</li>
    <li>Likely causes</li>
    <li>How to avoid it next time</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Brewer Tip:</strong> Don't just look up flaws you've tasted. Browse styles you brew often and note which faults they're most sensitive to.</p>

  <h4>Flavor Detail Pages</h4>
  <p>Clicking on any flavor opens a detailed breakdown showing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flavor family (Sulfur, Ester, Oxidation, or Other)</li>
    <li>Primary process stage: Mash &amp; Boil, Fermentation, Packaging</li>
    <li>Severity guidance that helps separate style-appropriate from batch-ruining</li>
    <li>Avoidance strategies with practical, actionable steps</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Two beers can taste fruity -- one because of yeast expression, the other because fermentation ran too warm. These pages help you tell the difference.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Learn by Doing: Training Tools</h3>

  <h4>Flashcards</h4>
  <p>The Flashcards section is perfect for solo study, pre-brew refreshers, and tasting party games.</p>
  <p>Each card describes a flavor, gives you multiple-choice options, and reinforces sensory memory through repetition.</p>
  <p><strong>Pro move:</strong> Use flashcards before tasting your beer to avoid bias. Let your palate speak first.</p>

  <h4>Sensory Training Mode</h4>
  <p>Sensory Training pulls the flavor library into a palate calibration workflow.</p>
  <p>Use it to prepare for BJCP judging, train on specific fault families, and improve your descriptive vocabulary.</p>
  <p>This mode encourages mindful tasting -- slowing down and connecting aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel.</p>

  <h3>Diagnose What Went Wrong (and Where)</h3>

  <h4>Diagnosis Wizard</h4>
  <p>If something tastes off but you can't put your finger on it, the Diagnosis Wizard helps narrow things down.</p>
  <p>It analyzes flavor descriptors, symptom keywords, and brewing stage indicators, then maps them to likely faults, most probable process stage, and associated process risks.</p>
  <p><strong>Why this is powerful:</strong> Instead of guessing whether your issue came from mash, fermentation, or packaging, the wizard nudges you toward the most likely culprit.</p>

  <h4>Style Risk Heatmap</h4>
  <p>The Style Risk Heatmap shows which off-flavors are most likely for a given beer style, risk levels (Low, Medium, High), and why certain styles are less forgiving.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A West Coast IPA is far more sensitive to oxidation and harsh bitterness than a robust stout. Seeing that visually helps prioritize process controls.</p>

  <h3>Printable Tools (Highly Recommended)</h3>

  <h4>Study Sheet (PDF)</h4>
  <p>Perfect for brew day prep, reference binders, and study sessions. Includes flavor, family, process stage, severity, causes, and prevention.</p>

  <h4>Troubleshooting Guide (PDF)</h4>
  <p>Designed for post-mortem analysis: what went wrong, where to look, and what to change next time. This is your next-batch-will-be-better document.</p>

  <h4>Tasting Scorecard (PDF)</h4>
  <p>A structured tasting form that aligns with flavor calibration cues, encourages consistent scoring, and builds long-term sensory awareness.</p>
  <p><strong>Brewer Tip:</strong> Save scorecards with your brew logs. Patterns will emerge over time, especially around fermentation temperature and packaging oxygen.</p>

  <h3>The Big Idea: Small Changes Matter</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Great beer isn't about avoiding mistakes -- it's about understanding cause and effect.
  </blockquote>

  <p>A 3F fermentation spike, an extra splash during bottling, or a rushed cold crash each leaves a fingerprint in the glass.</p>
  <p>This tool helps you see those fingerprints clearly, so your next batch isn't just different -- it's better.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Where to Go Next</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Brew a batch with one intentional variable change</li>
    <li>Taste it using the scorecard</li>
    <li>Compare against the Flavor Library</li>
    <li>Adjust one thing next time</li>
  </ul>

  <p>That's how good brewers become great ones.</p>
